This program is meant to show the proper use and allocation of threading a process. Utilizing the pthread library to demonstrate this feature.

Run Insrtuctions:
This project takes in three parameters in order:
1. A value between 0 < x < 2 (double)
2. Total number of threads you wish to create (int)
3. Total number of iterations you want the thread to calculate the natural log (More iterations equals more accurate answer) (int)

First run the make file. Then ./prog1 x x x
You should then be greated with the calcuated answer and math.h's natural log answer.
The calculated will be the value input from the user and calculated in the funciton.
